//    The !! operatorï»¿
//
//    The third option is for NPE-lovers: the not-null assertion operator (!!) converts any value to a non-null type and throws an exception if the value is null. You can write b!!, and this will return a non-null value of b (for example, a String in our example) or throw an NPE if b is null:
//
//    val l = b!!.length
//
//    Thus, if you want an NPE, you can have it, but you have to ask for it explicitly and it won't appear out of the blue.
